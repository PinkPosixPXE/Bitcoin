0x00] Introduction

      It is with great honor and satisfaction that The Bitcoin Foundation
      embraces this opportunity to address the public on the state of current
      progress, obstacles and continuing steps in our mission.

      Henceforth, The Bitcoin Foundation will provide an Address regarding its
      on-goings once per calendar month.

0x01] Accomplishments

      [ Review of Submitted Patches ]:
      First, it was decided to perform technical review on patches submitted
      and what overall impact these patches had on the Bitcoin v0.5.3 codebase.

      The following patch files were reviewed:
      0x0A]: bitcoin-asciilifeform.1.patch
      0x0B]: rm_rf_upnp.patch
      0x0C]: bitcoin-asciilifeform.2-https_snipsnip.patch
      0x0D]: bitcoin-asciilifeform.3-turdmeister-alert-snip.patch
      0x0E]: bitcoin-asciilifeform.4-goodbye-win32.patch
      0x0F]: reward_overwflow.patch

      During the patch testing phase, we noticed that Dignork's [R.03]
      patch [R.04] would not patch cleanly. The Bitcoin v0.5.3 [R.05] codebase
      with SHA256 Hash [R.06] already contains this bug fix so this submission
      has been left aside.

      Additionally, to get an idea of the overall scope and impact of patches
      submitted, we performed a numerical analysis of the files cut from the
      Bitcoin v0.5.3 codebase.

      asciilifeform's [R.07] manifest [R.08] file pares the Bitcoin v0.5.3
      codebase down to a total of 68 files from the initial 296 files.  We
      proceeded to count up the total lines from files pruned from the codebase:

      perl -e '
      @a=`cat /tmp/prune-bitcoin.files`; my $sum = 0;
      my $count = 0;
      foreach(@a) {
      chomp $_; my $r = `cat $_ | wc -l`; chomp $r; $sum = $sum + $r; $count++;
      }
      print "Number of files cut from v0.5.3 codebase: $count,
      total lines cut from files: $sum\n";
      '
      Number of files cut from v0.5.3 codebase: 228,
      total lines cut from files: 55697

      Next, we also performed a numerical analysis of how many lines were to
      be cut by patches from the 68 files remaining in the codebase:

      perl -e '
      @a=("bitcoin-asciilifeform.1.patch",
      "rm_rf_upnp/rm_rf_upnp.patch",
      "bitcoin-asciilifeform.2-https_snipsnip.patch",
      "bitcoin-asciilifeform.3-turdmeister-alert-snip.patch",
      "bitcoin-asciilifeform.4-goodbye-win32.patch");
      my $cut = 0;
      foreach(@a) {
      chomp $_; my $r = `cat $_ | egrep "^-" | wc -l`; $cut = $cut + $r;
      }
      print "Total lines cut from patches: $cut\n";
      '
      Total lines cut from patches: 1303

      Thanks to asciilifeform and ben_vulpes for submitting these patches, your
      efforts are greatly appreciated.

      [ Testing of Submitted Patches ]:
      Based upon objectives in the November ToDo list [R.09], we were
      successful in patching the Bitcoin v0.5.3 codebase and completing
      a successful compile of the patched code [R.0A].  The first
      requirement in section `0x0' was swept aside as each patch is dependant
      on the previous patch to patch the codebase cleanly.

      Once the all the patches [0x0A-0x0E above] were patched in cleanly, the
      patched v0.5.3 codebase compiled successfully.  Upon running the patched
      and compiled reference implementation it did successfully begin to pull
      down blocks from peers on the network.

      [ Wedge Issue at Block 252450 ]:
      ben_vulpes successfully reproduced the wedge at block 252450 with the
      unpatched Bitcoin v0.5.3 codebase.  [ There are current on-going efforts
      to reproduce the wedge at block 252450 with the patched codebase. ]

      kakobrekla [R.0B], very helpfully, charted the memory usage of the v0.7
      Bitcoin reference implementation to give a visual to the memory leaks
      occurring on or around block 252450 [R.0C].  This chart distinctly shows
      three spikes [green line] before his configuration change to Berkeley
      Database [R.0D] fixed the memory leak, allowing it to bypass the wedge
      block 252450.  The Foundation appreciates your efforts surrounding the
      wedging issue.

      These two accomplishments helped us to achieve our objectives `0x1' from
      the November ToDo list [R.09]: reproducing the wedge with v0.5.3 and
      having a more in-depth technical understanding of why the wedge occurs.

      [ Testing Environment ]:
      ben_vulpes is actively working on building a testing environment complete
      with a build & continuous integration server with additional instances
      ready for deployment.  This environment will allow us to work separately
      a sandbox and test changes.

      [ The Mailing List ]:
      jurov [R.0E], in addition to his Treasury duties, has configured Mailman
      to relay our BTC-Dev messages.  This was was an important task that also
      came with some unforeseen complications.  jurov's efforts in configuring
      and maintaining the mailing list are very much appreciated.

      [ A Script To Prune Files ]:
      mod6 created a document called ``Building with Patch Files'' [R.0A].  This
      document describes in detail how to build the reference implementation up
      to this point with the submitted patches.  A script was required to prune
      the Bitcoin v0.5.3 codebase down to 68 total files as directed by
      asciilifeform's manifest [R.08].  PinkPosixPXE [R.0F] was called upon to
      help build a script that accomplishes this task.  Her contribution is
      contained within mod6's document [R.0A].  We thank you for your efforts
      on such short notice, we appreciate it.

0x02] Complications and Obstacles

      During the first month of operations the complications obstacles were
      generally related to the ``boot-strapping'' of the foundation: Setting up
      environments for testing and analysis, discussions about overall strategy
      and approach to testing & schedule of tasks, and testing and debugging of
      the Wedge Issue at Block 252450.

      Overall, things are moving along nicely.

0x03] Continuing Steps

      Next month, December 2014, there will be continued regression testing of
      the patched v0.5.3 reference implementation.  As we have seen above there
      were a total of 228 files cut from the original v0.5.2 codebase for a
      total of 55697 lines of code.  As well as 1303 lines removed from the
      remaining 68 files.  This continued regression testing will help to
      ensure that the code has not regressed.  We want to ensure that all
      cruft removed from the codebase has not impacted any other
      functionality.

      There will also be continued analysis of the Wedge Issue at Block 252450
      as the reproduction of this problem with the patched reference
      implementation is still on-going.  Provided that the wedge issue is
      reproduced with the patched codebase, we will be attempting to change
      database configurations as kakobrekla did with his contribution [R.0D]
      to hopefully alleviate this condition.  In the case that it does not,
      further analysis and debugging will commence around this problem.

0x04] Conclusion

      The health and success of our beloved Bitcoin is the object of which
      our greatest cares and efforts ought to be directed, and we humbly ask
      for your continued cooperation and collaboration to set forth a
      lightweight, coherent and cruft-free reference implementation.

      The Bitcoin Foundation would like bestow our sincerest thanks and
      gratitude to the contributors and community for its support.
